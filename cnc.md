# CNC (Computer Numerical Control) Machine

Computer Numerical Control (CNC)) is an automated control of machining tools used for drills, boring tools, lathes etc. by means of a computer. This machine alters a blank piece of material usually wood or any other soft material which can retain its shape to meet precise specifications by following programmed instructions and without a manual operation.

CNC Machining is a process used in the manufacturing sector that involves the use of computers to control machine tools. Tools that can be controlled in this manner include lathes, mills, routers and grinders. The CNC in CNC Machining stands for Computer Numerical Control.

CNC machines combine a motorized movable tool or platform, which can be controlled by a computer operation with specific input instructions. Instructions are delivered to the machine through designs made in the computer which are transformed into a sequential machine instructions and then executed.

A CNC, or computer numerical control machine is a high precision tool that's computer-controlled and makes repeated, accurate movements. It does so by taking computer-generated code and converting it with software to electrical signals. It is quite expensive. CNC machines can do almost anything you need them to do.

Almost any material can be used in a CNC machine. It  depends on the application. Common materials include metals such as aluminum, brass, copper, steel, and titanium, as well as wood, foam, fiberglass, and plastics such as polypropylene. The material used in a CNC machine should be a solid which can retain its shape during fabrication. It is also necessary to take a note that the material used in a CNC should not be so hard that the milling bit is unable to cut. With CNC all major operations of production can be automated to increase speed and quality of manufacturing.

Working of a CNC:-

The motion of CNC is controlled along 3 axes. The CNC machine moves back and forth as well as sideways in X and Y axis respectively and a tool spindle that moves in the Z (depth) axis. A milling bit is attached to the spindle which rotates at a high speed and through its motion in Z axis provide the required shape to the material. The fabrication is done through the design which is converted into a machine language with specific input instructions through computer. Through the designs the origin point of the fabrication process is set-up and the machine is instructed to perform the fabrication operation as per the design.

CNC is a machine which operates in 3 dimensions. The basic operation of CNC is to fabricated wooden material or any other soft material which can hold its shape during the process of fabrication. It contains a milling bit which as per the programming assigned provides the required shapes in all the three dimensions. The CNC installed at FAB Lab is of Shop bot make and its dimensions are 96 inches x 48 inches. CNC is attached with a dust collector which during the process of fabrication collects the dust emitted from the material under fabrication.
