# CNC (Computer Numerical Control) Machine

CNC is a machine which operates in 3 dimensions. The basic operation of CNC is to             fabricated wooden material or any other soft material which can hold its shape during the process of fabrication. It contains a         milling bit which as per the programming assigned provides the required shapes in all the three dimensions. The CNC installed at FAB     Lab is of Shop bot make and its dimensions are 96 inches x 48 inches. CNC is attached with a dust collector which during the process     of fabrication collects the dust emitted from the material under fabrication.
