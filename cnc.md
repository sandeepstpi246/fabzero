# CNC (Computer Numerical Control) Machine

Computer Numerical Control (CNC)) is an automated control of machining tools used for drills, boring tools, lathes etc. by means of a computer. This machine alters a blank piece of material usually wood or any other soft material which can retain its shape to meet precise specifications by following programmed instructions and without a manual operation.

CNC machines combine a motorized movable tool or platform, which can be controlled by a computer operation with specific input instructions. Instructions are delivered to the machine through designs made in the computer which are transformed into a sequential machine instructions and then executed.

CNC is a machine which operates in 3 dimensions. The basic operation of CNC is to fabricated wooden material or any other soft material which can hold its shape during the process of fabrication. It contains a milling bit which as per the programming assigned provides the required shapes in all the three dimensions. The CNC installed at FAB Lab is of Shop bot make and its dimensions are 96 inches x 48 inches. CNC is attached with a dust collector which during the process of fabrication collects the dust emitted from the material under fabrication.
