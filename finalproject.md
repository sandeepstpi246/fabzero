## Final Project - (Automated Room Lighting System)

### Aim of the Project

To design, fabricate and prototyping of "AUTOMATED ROOM LIGHTING SYSTEM".

### Objective of the project:-

* The objective of this project is to make an Automated Room Lighting System which can automatically turn ON the lights by detecting the presence of human and turn OFF the light when no human presence is detected.

* This project is useful since it aims towards conservation of energy which is most important. 

* The product would be useful in the those areas which require lights only when it is in use for eg: Staircase area, washrooms etc.

### Working of the Project:-

* The circuit works on two conditions - one is presence of light in its location and second is presence of human being, only when these two conditions are met, the controller turns the backup light ON.

* These condition for operation of the product is tested by sensors which is PIR Motion sensor module. 

* PIR (Passive Infrared Sensor) is basically an IR (Infrared Receiver). It consists of sensitive IR receivers which detects the IR (Infra Red) rays in its region. Every living organism emits IR rays and so is the  case with human body. Whenever a there is a human in the sensor module region it detects the presence of IR rays. 

* Further, an LDR (Light Detecting Resistor) can be used with the product. When the light falling on the LDR is low, the resistance of the LDR will be high. When the light falling on LDR is high the resistance across terminals of LDR will be very low compared to low light resistance. so that, it may detect the light as well.

* On detecting the motion, the product switches the lights-ON. The process is reversed when no motion is detected and the microcontroller switches OFF the light.
