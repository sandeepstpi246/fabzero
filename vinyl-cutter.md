## Vinyl Cutter:- (Roland GS-24)

Vinyl Cutter is a type of computer-controlled machine. The computer attached to the printer controls the movement of a sharp blade over the surface of the material. This blade is used to cut out shapes and letters from sheets of thin self-adhesive plastic (vinyl). The vinyl can then be stuck to a variety of surfaces depending on the adhesive and type of material.

To cut out a design, a vector-based image must be created with software. We have used Inkskape for designing purpose. Further, the image or letters are sent to the cutter where it cuts along the vector paths laid out in the design. The cutter is capable of moving the blade on an X and Y axis over the material, cutting it into any shape imaginable. The vinyl sheet comes in a long roll because of which small designs or larger ones can be cut through the vinyl printer.

The one major limitation with vinyl cutters is that they can only cut shapes from solid colours of vinyl. A design with multiple colours must have each colour cut separately and then layered on top of each other as it is applied to the substrate. Also, since the shapes are cut out of solid colours, photographs and gradients cannot be reproduced with a stand alone cutter.

In addition to the capabilities of the cutter itself, the adhesive vinyl comes in a wide variety of colours and materials including gold and silver foil, vinyl that simulates frosted glass, holographic vinyl, reflective vinyl, thermal transfer material, and even clear vinyl imbedded with gold leaf. (Often used in the lettering on fire trucks and rescue vehicles.)

The blade of the cutter has to be adjusted in such a way that it cuts only the vinyl and not the adhesive sheet below the vinyl.

## Experiment- Vinyl Cutting

Further, Vinyl Cutter was demonstrated to the set of participants. The raw material used in the Vinyl Cutter is the Vinyl Sheet. This equipment is used by companies working in the field of signage and logo designing. The vinyl roll has to be properly placed between the rollers installed in the cutter. Further, there are some vertical line according to which the vinyl roll can be set-up in the cutter. For fixing the roll, it has to be place in the white section were the tube is having a rough surface soo that the grip is good. The user should also keep in mind that the vinyl is fixed at a position were there is minimum loss of vinyl sheet. Through this process the user can minimize the wastage of the vinyl sheet.
